# Freecam

Freecam adds a toggleable freecam camera for Hytale servers, letting players detach the camera from their character while preserving their original state and position. It includes adjustable speed controls and blocks interaction while freecam is active.

## Features
- Toggleable freecam with `/freecam` or `/fc`.
- Adjustable speed: `/freecam --speed 3` or `/fc --speed 3` (range 1-10).
- Restores player state and position when disabling freecam.
- Prevents block breaking while freecam is active.

## Commands
- `/freecam` - Toggle freecam on/off.
- `/fc` - Shortcut for `/freecam`.
- `/freecam <1-10>` - Set freecam speed (also enables freecam if it is off).
- `/freecam --speed <1-10>` or `/freecam --speed=<1-10>` - Set freecam speed.

## Notes
- This mod is server-side and does not modify client files.
- Use responsibly; this mod does not promote cheats, griefing tools, or disruptive behavior.

## Permissions
